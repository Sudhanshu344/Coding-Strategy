Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t modulo 10^9 + 7. Using Dynamic programming approach.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.
<rabb>b<it>
<rab>b<bit>
<ra>b<bbit>
Example 2:

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from s.
<ba>b<g>bag
<ba>bgba<g>
<b>abgb<ag>
ba<b>gb<ag>
babg<bag>
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
s and t consist of English letters.
